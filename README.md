## Multi-Tenant Considerations

### Current State

- Hardcoded branding and configuration
- Direct database connections

### Future Multi-Tenant Architecture
- **Tenant Isolation** - Separate data and configurations per business
- **Dynamic Branding** - Runtime theme and branding customization
- **Scalable Infrastructure** - Support for thousands of storefronts
- **API Gateway** - Centralized routing and tenant resolution

4. Test thoroughly on mobile and desktop
5. Commit with clear messages (`git commit -m 'Add amazing feature'`)
6. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
7. Open a Pull Request

### Code Standards
- **TypeScript**: All code must be properly typed
- **ESLint**: Follow the established linting rules
- **Component Structure**: Use functional components with hooks
